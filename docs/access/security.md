The **HPC system at Tribhuvan University** follows **strict security policies** to ensure **data integrity, system stability, and secure access**. All users must follow these security guidelines to maintain a **safe computing environment**.

## 1. User Authentication & Access Control
- **SSH Key-Based Authentication**: Users must use **SSH keys** for remote access; password-based authentication is disabled.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: If enabled, users must follow the additional authentication steps.
- **User Account Management**:
  - Each user must have a unique account.
  - **Sharing credentials is strictly prohibited**.
  - Users must update their passwords regularly and use **strong password policies**.

## 2. Data Security & Privacy
- Users must **not store sensitive personal data** or proprietary research data without encryption.
- All data must be stored in **designated directories** (`/home`, `/mnt/storage0`) following storage policies.
- **Data backups are the responsibility of the users**; the HPC system provides limited backup capabilities.
- Users should not share or transfer research data without appropriate permissions.

## 3. Network & Remote Access Security
- The HPC system is hosted at **ITIC Tribhuvan University**, and **NAT is managed by TU ITIC and the Registrar Office**.
- **Only authorized users can access the system remotely via SSH**.
- **Public-facing services are restricted**; users cannot expose any services without administrator approval.
- **No unauthorized VPNs, proxies, or tunneling methods** should be used.

## 4. Software Installation & Execution Policies
- Users **cannot install system-level software** without approval.
- All software requests should be made via **[madhav [dot] ghimire @ cdp [dot] tu [dot] edu [dot] np]**.
- Executable files must be **scanned for security risks** before running.
- Users must **not run scripts that consume excessive resources** or cause instability.

## 5. Job Submission & Fair Usage
- Users must ensure **efficient job scheduling** and avoid unnecessary resource hogging.
- Long-running jobs must be **checked and optimized** to minimize impact on shared resources.
- **Priority scheduling is based on fair usage policies**; abusing the system may result in restricted access.

## 6. Incident Reporting & Policy Violations
- Users must report **security incidents or suspicious activities** immediately to **support**.
- Violations of security policies may result in **temporary or permanent suspension**.
- Regular audits are conducted to monitor compliance and ensure the integrity of the HPC system.

## 7. Future Security Enhancements
- Implementation of **enhanced network monitoring tools**.
- Regular **security awareness training** for users.
- Exploring **VPN-based secure access for external researchers**.
